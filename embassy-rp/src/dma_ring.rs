//! Continuous DMA receive ring built from two chained channels.
//!
//! This is the transport-agnostic half of the ring-buffered RX drivers. It receives
//! continuously into a circular pool of DMA buffers, with no per-byte interrupt and no CPU
//! involvement between buffers.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! Two DMA channels are wired into a self-perpetuating loop:
//!
//! - The **data** channel copies a fixed source register into one segment of the pool.
//! - The **control** channel walks a small table of segment pointers and writes the next one
//!   into the data channel's `WRITE_ADDR`, then chains back to re-trigger it.
//!
//! `TRANS_COUNT` is a reload register on RP2040/RP2350 — the written value is copied into the
//! live counter on every trigger — so neither channel ever needs re-arming. The control
//! channel's read address wraps around the pointer table via `RING_SIZE`/`RING_SEL`, so the
//! loop runs forever without the CPU.
//!
//! The data channel raises its completion interrupt (`irq_quiet = false`) once per segment,
//! which is what wakes a blocked reader. Reception itself does not depend on that interrupt
//! being serviced promptly; only the wakeup latency and the overrun bookkeeping do.
//!
//! A front end supplies exactly four things: the source address, the DREQ, and (implicitly)
//! that transfers are byte-sized with a non-incrementing read address.
//!
//! # Position tracking
//!
//! The hardware has no lap counter, so the absolute write position is reconstructed from two
//! samples: the per-channel completion count maintained by [`dma::InterruptHandler`], and the
//! channel's live `WRITE_ADDR`. The completion count gives the lap, the write address gives the
//! offset within it.
//!
//! A DMA `INTS` bit is a single latched flag, so several segment completions occurring before
//! the handler runs are counted once. [`Pos::apply`] absorbs that: the write address says how
//! far past the counted segment the DMA really is, which recovers the missed completions as
//! long as fewer than a full lap (`NBUFS`) were lost. Only losing a whole lap of interrupts
//! *and* being a whole pool behind is ambiguous, and that is reported as an overrun rather
//! than silently returning stale bytes.
